# Java Algorithm Implementations

This project contains various common algorithmic implementations in Java, focusing on recursion and basic mathematical operations. Each method solves a specific problem such as finding the minimum value in an array, calculating the factorial, checking whether a number is prime, and more.

## Overview

The project includes the following tasks:

1. **Find the minimum value in an array**.
2. **Calculate the average of array elements**.
3. **Check if a number is prime**.
4. **Calculate the factorial using recursion**.
5. **Calculate the Fibonacci number using recursion**.
6. **Calculate the power of a number using recursion**.
7. **Print an array in reverse order using recursion**.
8. **Check if a string contains only digits**.
9. **Calculate the binomial coefficient using recursion**.
10. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm**.

## Features

- All algorithms are implemented using recursion.
- Time complexity for each algorithm is discussed in the comments within the code.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
3. Enter the required input as prompted by the program.


## Time Complexity

Each method has its own time complexity, which is explained in the comments. For example:

- **findMin**: O(n) — We iterate over all elements to find the minimum value.
- **factorial**: O(n) — The method calculates the factorial recursively.
- **fibonacci**: O(2^n) — The method calculates Fibonacci numbers with exponential time complexity due to overlapping subproblems.
- **gcd**: O(log(min(a,b))) — This is the time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm for GCD.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates common recursive algorithms and basic mathematical operations. It's a great starting point for learning recursion and algorithm design in Java.
